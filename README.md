## 📌 Project Overview
This repository serves as a centralized hub for my 144-day intensive cybersecurity roadmap. It documents my technical growth from foundational networking to advanced penetration testing and security operations.

## 🚀 Current Milestone: Linux Foundations II (Day 8)
I have successfully completed the foundational administration of services and am now moving into **User Management and Security Permissions**.

### 🛠️ Technical Skill Set (Updated)
* **Operating Systems:** Kali Linux (Primary), Ubuntu, Windows Server.
* **Networking:** OSI Model, TCP/IP, DNS, Service Discovery.
* **Package Management:** `apt`, `dpkg` (Debian-based systems).
* **System Administration:** `systemctl` service management, process monitoring, terminal logging.
* **Security Concepts:** Attack Surface Reduction (Service Hardening), Permission Management.
* **Tools:** Cisco Packet Tracer, Wireshark, Nmap, Git/GitHub.

## 🔬 Lab Highlights: Day 7
**Task:** Package Management & Service Hardening.
* **Objective:** Deploy an Nginx web server and secure the system by managing active services.
* **Actions Taken:** 1. Used `apt` to manage and install system packages.
    2. Successfully deployed the **Nginx** master and worker processes.
    3. **Hardened the system** by stopping the `ssh` service (`sudo systemctl stop ssh`) to reduce the attack surface.
* **Outcome:** Verified server status via `systemctl` and confirmed reduced external accessibility for improved security posture.

## 🔬 Upcoming Lab: Day 8
**Focus:** User Management & The Principle of Least Privilege.
* **Objective:** Creating restricted user accounts and mastering `chmod`/`chown` to protect sensitive system files.
